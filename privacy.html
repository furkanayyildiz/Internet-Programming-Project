      requests and/or where you have volunteered information for use by us). In other cases, we may seek your consent
      expressly in accordance with applicable laws (e.g. where the information collected is regarded by law to be

    <h2>3. ONLINE USER ACTIVITY</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      We may collect technical information about visitors to our Services (“Online User Activity”), through cookies and
      other technology. We, our service providers, and our business partners, may employ cookies and the other
      technologies described below to remember you when you return to our Services (or keep you logged in), collect
      information about how our Services are used, review website traffic patterns and improve the Services, and
      determine what Services are popular. We can also use such information to deliver customized content and
      advertising to users of the Services whose behavior indicates that they have particular interests.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <p>Cookies are a commonly used web technology that allow websites to store and retrieve certain information on a
      user’s browser, and track certain online activities. Clear GIFs (also called “pixels”, "web bugs" or "web
      beacons") are small transparent images placed on a web page or in an email message to monitor user behavior,
      deliver cookies, collect information, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and detect if a
      recipient has opened and acted upon an email. Other such technologies include Local Storage Objects (LSOs) which
      can store content information and preferences on a user device, and Software Development Kits (SDKs) from vendors
      or service providers may be embedded in our apps to provide various functionality, including an ability to collect
      information about user activity. Finally, our Services maintain network and system logs of activity on our
      Services and provide another way for us to gather statistics about users’ browsing habits, such as how many and
      how often users have accessed or used our Services, which pages were visited and other similar data.
